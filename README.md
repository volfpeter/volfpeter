Hi,

Iâ€™m Peter Volf, SW engineer for many years now with a master's degree in computer science, located in Hungary.

My main professional interest has been Python ever since I first started using it around ~2008. I really enjoy working with React and TypeScript, and doing full-stack application development as well. I'm also interested in Linux and the open-source world in general. At university, I specialized in network/graph analysis and machine learning -- it was a long time ago, it would be great to have the time to pick these up again.

I work mostly on greenfield web projects and -- when my time allows -- I like to do open-source work.

Some of my open source projects:
- [localclustering](https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering) is a local graph clustering algorithm with a `graphscraper` backend ([JOSS publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00960), [analysis](https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering/blob/master/documents/Algorithm%20Analysis%20with%20the%20Spotify%20Related%20Artists%20Graph.ipynb)).
- [fasthx](https://github.com/volfpeter/fasthx) is an HTMX utility for FastAPI.
- [htmy](https://github.com/volfpeter/htmy) is an async rendering engine primarily for HTML and XML, and server-side rendering.
- [motorhead](https://github.com/volfpeter/motorhead) is an async "almost-ODM" for MongoDB with vanilla Pydantic v2.
- [graphscraper](https://github.com/volfpeter/graphscraper) is an SQL graph database with an in-memory cache and a built-in, on-demand web scraper (for research projects).
- [uspto-patent-citation-graph](https://github.com/volfpeter/uspto-patent-citation-graph) is a `graphscraper` implementation that scrapes the citation graph from USPTO's API (for research projects).
- [mastodon-social-graph](https://github.com/volfpeter/mastodon-social-graph) is a `graphscraper` implementation that scrapes the social graph of a Mastodon instance (for research projects).
- [markyp](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp) is an XML templating engine and parser tool.

My recent professional projects:
- Prototyped the new IoT device management portal for [SmartNow](https://www.smart-now.com/solutions/portal/).
- [AIP Clinic](https://www.aipclinic.com/) and [AIP Derm](https://www.aipderm.com/), an AI-assisted digital healthcare service.
- Prototyped the [LNGx platform](https://www.lngx.es/), a modern energy trading hub.
- [Horizon Planner](https://milinnovations.gitlab.io/horizon-developer-blog/), an enterprise resource planning and project management application.

I also tutor engineers, from juniors to seniors, primarily focusing on Python and system architecture/design.
