Hi,

Iâ€™m Peter Volf, SW engineer for many years now with a master's degree in computer science, located in Hungary.

My main professional interest has been Python ever since I first started using it around ~2008. I also really enjoy working with React and TypeScript, and doing full-stack application development. I'm also interested in Linux and the open-source world in general. At university, I specialized in network/graph analysis and machine learning -- it was a long time ago, it would be great to have the time to pick these up again.

I'm fascinated by everything that is simple and elegant, but gives rise to complex behaviors. I try to create such software at work.

I work as a contractor, mostly on greenfield enterprise web application projects. When my time allows -- unfortunately not nearly as often as I'd like these days -- I like to do some open-source work.

Some of my more interesting projects are:
- [localclustering](https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering) is a local graph clustering algorithm with a simple SQL backend ([JOSS publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00960), [analysis](https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering/blob/master/documents/Algorithm%20Analysis%20with%20the%20Spotify%20Related%20Artists%20Graph.ipynb)).
- [markyp](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp) is an XML templating engine and parser tool.
- [markyp-html](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp-html) is an HTML implementation based on `markyp` that lets you write static webpages 100% in Python (i.e., without Jinja templates).
- [markyp-bootstrap4](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp-bootstrap4) is a full Bootstrap4 implementation based on `markyp-html`.
- [Horizon Planner](https://milinnovations.gitlab.io/horizon-developer-blog/), my most recent professional project.
