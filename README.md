Hi,

Iâ€™m Peter Volf, SW engineer for many years now with a master's degree in computer science, located in Hungary.

My main professional interest has been Python ever since I first started using it around ~2008. I really enjoy working with React and TypeScript, and doing full-stack application development as well. I'm also interested in Linux and the open-source world in general. At university, I specialized in network/graph analysis and machine learning -- it was a long time ago, it would be great to have the time to pick these up again.

I work mostly on greenfield web projects. When my time allows -- unfortunately not nearly as often as I'd like these days -- I like to do some open-source work.

Some of my more interesting hobby projects are:
- [localclustering](https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering) is a local graph clustering algorithm with a `graphscraper` backend ([JOSS publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00960), [analysis](https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering/blob/master/documents/Algorithm%20Analysis%20with%20the%20Spotify%20Related%20Artists%20Graph.ipynb)).
- [motorhead](https://github.com/volfpeter/motorhead) is an async almost-ODM for MongoDB with vanilla Pydantic v2.
- [graphscraper](https://github.com/volfpeter/graphscraper) is an SQL graph database with an in-memory cache and a built-in, on-demand web scraper.
- [mastodon-social-graph](https://github.com/volfpeter/mastodon-social-graph) is a `graphscraper` implementation that loads the social graph of a Mastodon instance.
- [uspto-patent-citation-graph](https://github.com/volfpeter/uspto-patent-citation-graph) is a `graphscraper` implementation that loads the citation graph from USPTO's API.
- [markyp](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp) is an XML templating engine and parser tool.
- [markyp-html](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp-html) is an HTML implementation based on `markyp` that lets you write static webpages 100% in Python (i.e., without Jinja-like templating).
- [markyp-bootstrap4](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp-bootstrap4) is a full Bootstrap4 implementation based on `markyp-html`.

My recent professional projects:
- Currently I work on [AIP Derm](https://www.aipderm.com/), an AI-assisted digital dermatology hospital.
- [Horizon Planner](https://milinnovations.gitlab.io/horizon-developer-blog/), an enterprise resource planning and project management application (tech lead/principal engineer, 2019-2023).
